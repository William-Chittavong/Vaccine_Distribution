# Vaccine_Distribution

Lists the names of the fellow contributors in the document. 

The submission file includes the queries, database design process, and implementation.

The project required the group to submit the database and web files to school servers. 

Most of our work was done on those servers and not through github.

Unfortunately they were deleted shortly after the semester had ended. 

The code for creation of the tables and insertion statements are in the report. 

I am in the proccess of recreating and improving on the display of the database on a webpage.
